# Time Tracking App - Notes Feature

## Changes Made

1. Updated the `TimeEntry` interface in `types.ts` to include the `notes` field:
```typescript
export interface TimeEntry {
    id: string;
    projectName: string;
    hours: number;
    minutes: number;
    rate: number;
    date: string;
    dateObj: Date;
    notes?: string;  // Added this line
}
```

## Notes Feature Details

After reviewing the code, I found that the application already has full support for notes in time entries:

### UI Components
- Text areas for entering notes in both the timer and manual entry forms
- Notes display in the time entries table with show/hide toggle buttons

### Data Handling
- State variables for tracking notes (`timerNotes` and `manualNotes`)
- Notes are saved when creating time entries
- Notes are included when exporting to CSV
- Notes are imported from CSV files

### Implementation
The notes functionality was already well-implemented in the app, but the type definition was missing the `notes` field, which has been fixed.

## Files Modified
- `/src/types.ts` - Added the notes field to the TimeEntry interface

## How to Use Notes
1. **Timer Entry**: When using the timer, add notes in the "Notes (Optional)" field before stopping the timer.
2. **Manual Entry**: When adding a time entry manually, fill in the "Notes (Optional)" field.
3. **Viewing Notes**: In the time entries table, click the "Show" button to view notes for an entry.
4. **Editing Notes**: Click the "Edit" button for an entry to edit its notes.

The notes field has a maximum length of 500 characters.
